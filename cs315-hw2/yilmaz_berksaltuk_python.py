# Loops in Python

# There is no C type loop in Python :(
# However, we can use range function for this purpose
# Like range( init, end, incr/decr step)
for i in range(0, 4, 1): # NOT LOGICALLY CONTROLLED, JUST ADDED FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES :)
    print("LLOOOOPP " + str(i))

##!!NOT!! logically controlled but you can try them also if you want
# It is also possible to iterate through a list, dictionary or tuple
# # Tuple is the same, just replace [] with ()
# favShows = ['Bojack', 'BrBa', 'SoA', 'The Office', 'Dexter']
# for show in favShows:
#     print(show)
# # Iterating a dictionary!
# favShows2 = {1: "Bojack", 2: "The Office", 3: "Dexter", 4: "BrBa", 5: "SoA"}
# for show in favShows2:
#     print("Show #" + str(show) + " is " + favShows2[show])
# # in Python it is also possible to else to a for or while loop
