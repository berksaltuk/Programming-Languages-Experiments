# Ruby Subprograms!

# Design issues to be addressed:
    # Subprogram overloading
    # Return values
    # Nested subprogram definitions
    # Scope of local variables
    # Parameter passing methods
    # Keyword and default parameters
    # Closures

# I swear I will not print hel...

# GOD! I COULD NOT RESIST!

puts "------------------- PROBLEM 1: SUBPROGRAM OVERLOADING! -------------------";
## Let's start with "Subprogram overlading"...
# Ruby does not support subprogram overloading since it has dynamic typing
# for example there is no such definitions in Ruby: foo(int a) or foo(string a)
# hence it is not possible to overload a subprogram by changing the types of arguments
# Moreover, it is not also possible to have two methods foo(a) and foo(a, b) which confuses
# the Ruby, and it allows unique names for functions

def berk(a)
    puts a
end

def berk(a, b)
    puts a+b
end

# berk(5) # Error!

puts "------------------- PROBLEM 2: RETURN VALUES! -------------------";
# First of all...
# In ruby if we do not specify return value with "return" statement, it automatically returns the last line of code!
def foo()
    str = "I want to return this!"

    str
    "HAHA"
end

puts foo()

# To stop this behavior we should add return
def foo2()
    str = "I want to return this!"

    return str
    "HAHA"
end

puts foo2()

# It is possible to return any data type in Ruby: string, numbers, arrays, hashes, symbols...
def foo3(b, s, y)
    return b*s*y, "berk", 1999, [3,4,5], {"berk"=>"I cry myself to sleep", "burcu"=>"Hi!"}, :bsy  # As well as returning only 1 value as in foo2, it is possible to return multiple values
end

puts foo3(2,3,4) # It prints aaaaall values returned from this function
# It is also possible to access elements one by one!
puts "Element in index 1: #{foo3(2, 3, 4)[1]}" 
puts foo3(2,3,4)[3][2]
puts "#{foo3(2,3,4)[4]['berk']}"

def dummy()

end
puts dummy() # This prints literally nothing :(
yummy = dummy()
puts yummy.inspect # Type of yummy is nil...

# You made it to the end of this section!

# According to our textbook, Ruby has pass-by-assignment
# we can say each variable is a reference to objects that we put in them
# when we say a = 33, this means a is a reference to the memory block 
# that holds 33, we can represent this as a -> [33]

# for example when both values are not changeable (in other words immutable)
# when they are passed in functions, the objects that is referenced by variables
# will not change at all. It can be said that if the referenced object is mutable
# Ruby changes the value of referenced object.

# But in the example below both referenced objects are immutable
# So x references another object after the assignment operator and the value in main does not change
def adder(x, y)
